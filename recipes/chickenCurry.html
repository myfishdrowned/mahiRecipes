    <h2>Chicken curry is a flavorful dish enjoyed in various cuisines around the world, from the aromatic curries of
        India to the creamy coconut-infused versions of Southeast Asia. This dish typically features tender pieces of
        chicken simmered in a rich and spiced curry sauce, made with a blend of herbs, spices, and ingredients like
        garlic, ginger, onions, and tomatoes. The result is a hearty, satisfying meal often served with steamed rice,
        naan, or flatbreads.</h2>

        First Steps: Preparing the Base To begin, heat oil or ghee in a large pan or skillet and sauté finely chopped
        onions until golden brown. Add minced garlic and ginger, stirring until fragrant. Next, incorporate ground
        spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala for an earthy and aromatic base. For a richer
        flavor, consider adding a cinnamon stick or a few cloves. Once the spices are toasted, stir in diced tomatoes
        and cook until they form a thick paste. This base is the foundation of your curry’s bold flavor.

    <p>Cooking the Chicken and Finalizing the Curry Add the chicken pieces to the spiced tomato base, ensuring they are
        well-coated in the mixture. Cook the chicken until it is lightly browned. Pour in water, chicken broth, or
        coconut milk depending on your preferred curry consistency. Simmer gently, allowing the chicken to cook through
        and the flavors to meld together. For extra flavor, add fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice just before
        serving. Pair your chicken curry with hot basmati rice or buttery naan for a complete meal that’s sure to
        impress.
